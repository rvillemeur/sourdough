a small calculator for sourdough proportion

Creating sourdough bread is an art and a science. The proportion of the ingredient can lead to different results.

This small calculator is (strongly) inspired by the one found here (in French): http://www.nicrunicuit.com/archives/2014/06/29/30055037.html
Explanation on the calculation can be found here (in French): http://votrepain.com/2010/03/reflexions-sur-lhydratation-dun-levain-ou-dune-pate-par-jean-michel/

This project was as well used as an exercise to get more familiar with the Pharo Smalltalk Spec UI Framework.
